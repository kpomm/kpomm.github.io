This repository holds all the files used for my website, a personal project I started in May 2022. This project will be updated with my CS & Photography Portfolios, and my Resume. Thanks for checking it out! More constant updates are shown in kpomm/personal-website. These changes are reflected in kpomm.com/personal-website.
